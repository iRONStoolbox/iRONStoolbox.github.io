## iRONS (interactive Reservoir Operation Notebooks and Software)

iRONS is a Python package that enables the simulation, forecasting and optimisation of reservoir systems. iRONS provides a set of Python functions (iRONS Software) implementing typical reservoir modelling task and a set of interactive Jupyter Notebooks (iRONS Notebooks) that demonstrate key functionalities through practical examples (Peñuela et al. 2021).

### iRONS Software

The iRONS Software is a set of Python functions implementing typical reservoir modelling tasks, such as: estimating inflows to a reservoir, simulating operator decisions, closing the reservoir mass balance equation – in the context of both short-term forecasting and long-term predictions.

You can download the functions from the iRONS Github repository: [iRONS Software](https://github.com/iRONStoolbox/iRONStoolbox/iRONS/Software/)

### iRONS Notebooks

The package includes a set of interactive Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate key functionalities through practical examples, and that can be run in the Jupyter environment either locally or remotely via a web browser.
The notebooks included in iRONS are divided in two sections:

**A.	[Knowledge Transfer (KT) Notebooks](./KT_Notebooks.md/):** A set of simple examples to demonstrate the value of simulation and optimisation tools for water resources management – i.e. why one should use these tools in the first place. 

**B.	[Implementation Notebooks](./Implementation_Notebooks.md/):** A set of workflow examples showing how to apply the iRONS functions to more complex problems such as: generating inflow forecasts through a rainfall-runoff model (including bias correcting weather forecasts); optimising release scheduling against an inflow scenario or a forecast ensemble; optimising an operating policy against time series of historical or synthetic inflows.

You can download the Notebooks from the iRONS Github repository: [iRONS Notebooks](https://github.com/iRONStoolbox/iRONStoolbox/iRONS/Notebooks/)

The iRONS Notebooks can be run on the cloud by using Binder (https://mybinder.org/), so that they are accessible by a web browser without requiring the installation of Python. Just click [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/iRONStoolbox/iRONStoolbox/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fnotebooks%2FiRONS/Notebooks)
